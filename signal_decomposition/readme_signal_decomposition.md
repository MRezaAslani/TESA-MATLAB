# Signal Subband Decomposition using DSCA

This folder contains MATLAB scripts for performing **signal decomposition** using the proposed **Direct Sinusoidal Component Analysis (DSCA)** method. The goal is to decompose a composite signal (e.g., overlapping chirps) into interpretable frequency subbands, visualize their spectral content, and evaluate reconstruction accuracy.

## ðŸ“‚ Files Included

### `main_signal_demo.m`

- Main script to:
  - Generate a synthetic composite chirp signal
  - Decompose it using DSCA
  - Group subbands into four frequency bands (VLF, MF, HF, VHF)
  - Display time-domain plots and spectrograms
  - Reconstruct the original signal and compute evaluation metrics

### `dsca.m`

- Core DSCA algorithm that computes narrowband components using sinusoidal correlation
- Works for both 1D signals and 2D images

### `generate_chirp.m`

- (Optional) Modular function to generate the synthetic test signal

### `metrics_signal.m`

- (Optional) Computes SNR, RMSE, correlation, and subband independence metrics
