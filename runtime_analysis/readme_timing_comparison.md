## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup

- The test script executes each method **100 times per signal length**, and averages are recorded.
- DSCA uses the `fastDSCA` module.
- DWT uses MATLAB's `wavedec` and `wrcoef` functions (db4, level 5).

## üìà Timing Plot

![Timing Plot](timing.png)

The chart above shows that **DSCA** has **very low initial latency** for short signals and increases **approximately linearly**, while DWT remains relatively constant regardless of signal length.

---

## üìå Observations

- DSCA is faster for signals shorter than ~250 samples.
- DSCA timing grows with signal length due to per-frequency component synthesis.
- DWT shows fixed-cost behavior thanks to recursive structure.
