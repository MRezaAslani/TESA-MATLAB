function x_admm = admm(x, target_spectrogram, fs, window, noverlap, nfft, num_iters)
%% Method Name: Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM)
% Inputs: x (input), target_spectrogram (target), fs, window, noverlap, nfft, rho (penalty), num_iters.
% Outputs: x_admm (reconstructed signal).
% Note: Simplified ADMM for spectrogram inversion.
