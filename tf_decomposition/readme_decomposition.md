## üé° Objective

The goal of this experiment is to evaluate the capability of DSCA in **separating multiple overlapping time-frequency components** from a complex signal.

- The input signal is synthesized by randomly assigning multiple sinusoidal bursts across time.
- A binary spectrogram is constructed to locate dominant time-frequency regions.
- DSCA is applied to extract and reconstruct each region as a separate component.

This demonstrates DSCA's strength in **adaptive segmentation** of non-stationary signals.

## üìä Observations

- The DSCA decomposition successfully identifies and isolates dominant energy components from the time-frequency plane.
- Visual inspection of spectrograms confirms that each component captures a unique frequency pattern.
- The correlation between reconstructed subcomponents is low, indicating **informative and non-overlapping decomposition**.
- Quantitative metrics for reconstruction accuracy:

```
SNR: 2.09 dB
RMSE: 0.492
Correlation with original: 0.735
Max inter-component correlation: 0.0182
```

These values support the fact that the reconstruction retains relevant structures while minimizing interference between components.
