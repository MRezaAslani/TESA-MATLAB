# Application 2: Selective Frequency Filtering using CCA

This folder contains MATLAB code for applying **Correlation Coefficients Adjustment (CCA)** as a **bandpass** or **bandstop** filter for selective frequency manipulation in non-stationary signals.

## üìÅ Files Included

### `main_filter_demo.m`

Main script for performing the filtering experiment:

- Generates a synthetic non-stationary signal composed of sinusoidal segments with different frequencies.
- Constructs a target signal based on selected frequency indices.
- Applies CCA-based filtering using STFT-domain spectral masking.
- Displays time-domain signals and spectrograms.
- Computes evaluation metrics (SNR, RMSE, Correlation).

### `functions/`

Contains helper functions used in the main experiment:

## üìä Evaluation Metrics

After filtering, the output signal is compared with the constructed target signal:

- **SNR**: Signal-to-Noise Ratio
- **MSE**: Mean Square Error
- **PCC**: Pearson's Correlation Coefficient

Example output:

```
--- Evaluation Metrics for 'bandpass' Mode ---
SNR: 1.1950 dB
RMSE: 0.2470
Correlation: 0.6658
```
```
--- Evaluation Metrics for 'bandstop' Mode ---
SNR: 0.2575 dB
RMSE: 0.6831
Correlation: 0.4809
```
